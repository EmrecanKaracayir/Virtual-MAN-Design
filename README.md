# Virtual MAN Design

## Project Description

The goal of our project is to create a network that connects two branches of an office in a city using Cisco Packet Tracer software. Our aim is to ensure that the network architecture supports maximum users and traffic load with minimum delay, all while keeping the cost of hardware equipment in mind.

To accomplish this, we must carefully analyze the network requirements and specifications of each facility in the two branches. For example, the first branch office has three distinct facilities, each with different requirements. The first facility has 10 workstation users, 3 wireless users, and 3 smartphone users who need internet access to browse the web, send e-mails, and transfer files using their devices. The second facility has 5 workstation users who use web and FTP, with 3 of these workstations used for VoIP conference events. The third facility has a server farm with 5 web servers, 2 FTP servers, 1 DHCP server, 1 mail server, and 1 domain name server (DNS).

Similarly, the second branch has three distinct facilities with different requirements. The first facility has 10 workstation users, 5 wireless users, and 10 tablet users who require wireless internet access to browse the web and use e-mail applications. The second facility has 10 workstation users and 5 smartphone users who need internet access to browse the web, edit applications, and transfer files. The third facility has 10 workstations and 5 mobile devices that need internet access to browse the web, send and receive e-mails.
